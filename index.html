<p class="Text">Hi! My name is Madison Bailey and I am a student at <strong>the University of Georgia</strong>. Ever since I was a little girl I have wanted to attend UGA. My mom went to UGA and so I was raised as a Georgia fan. I dreamed of the day that I got my acceptance letter and could attend the best school ever. When I got accepted in November of my senior year of high school, I was ecstatic. My mom and I jumped up and down and cried tears of joy. Now, I am in my second year here! My major is marketing which is in the business school, Terry. Next semester, I will be officially applying to the business school and begin taking business classes. 
</p>
<p class="Text" style="text-align:left">Before getting accepted to UGA, I decided I wanted to look at big, southern schools. I applied to:</p>
<ol style="text-align:left">
	<li class="Text" style="text-align:left">Alabama</li>
	<li class="Text" style="text-align:left">Auburn</li>
	<li class="Text" style="text-align:left">Clemson</li>
</ol>	
<p class="Text">In my first three semesters at UGA, I have taken a few general level classes that are essential in order to apply to the business school. My favorite class I have taken so far was Interpersonal Communications. We learned about how people interact with each other and different styles of communication. I found it very interesting! Although I have enjoyed the classes I have taken so far, I cannot wait to begin classes in my major! </p>
<p class="Text">As of now, I am a marketing major, but I am still figuring out what career path I want to take. Luckily I think I still have time to figure out the exact job I want to do one day, but I know for sure that I want to work in the corporate business world. I am a very socialable person so I would love to work in sales and be able to interact with others. I am so thankful to go to UGA because even just as a sophomore I have already been given many opportunities to succeed and figure out who I want to be! </p>
